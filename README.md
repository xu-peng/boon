## Use Boo<sub>n</sub> !
You can find a Python implementation of the empirical estimator of Boo<sub>n</sub> in `boon/boon.py`. You can also install
it using

```bash
pip install boon
```

Then, having your validation results in the `valid` array and the corresponding test results in the `test` array, you can calculate e.g. Boo<sub>5</sub> (default) using
```python
from boon import boo
boo5 = boo(valid, test, n=5, best='max')
```
The `best='max'` (default) indicates that you are using a metric where higher is better (e.g. accuracy). For metrics such as the error rate, set `best='min'`.


## Work in progress
We are still tidying up some of the code for release. However, we are gradually making it available.

## Data analysis
The notebook `notebooks/PerformanceDistributions.ipynb` captures the analysis performed for Section 4.

## Data
Data used to produce the results can be found in `notebooks/results`.
